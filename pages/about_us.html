                <h2>The Team</h2>
                <p>When you took your first look on our website, you might have thought that we were a bunch working behind, didn'tcha ?
                    Well sorry to break the myth, but we're only 2 ! However, we both prefer to stay anonymous, since this project is on a public Github repository.
                </p>
                <p>We're of course fervent video game enjoyers, as we tried games ranging from visual novels to obnoxiously raging rogue-likes. 
                    But as we dove into deeper in this world, we realized that the best one we've tried come from small creators ! As a tribute to them, our website came to life.

                <p>We're always happy to get YOUR point of view on the games we played ! After all, stories hit different according to the reader and its past exeperiences.
