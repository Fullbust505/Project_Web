                <h2>The Team</h2>
                <p>When you took your first look on our website, you might have thought that we were a bunch working behind, didn'tcha ?
                    Well sorry to break the myth, but we're only 2 ! However, we both prefer to stay anonymous, since this project is on a public Github repository.
                    We dedicate most of our time to computer science, for our studies, but whenever we have free time, videogames are right around the corner. 
                </p>
                <p>We're of course fervent video game enjoyers, as we tried games ranging from visual novels to obnoxiously raging rogue-likes. 
                    Since we were born and raised controller in hands, we followed the evolution of this modern hobby from the PS2 to nowadays technology.
                    But as we dove deeper into this world, we realized that the best one we've tried come from small creators ! As a tribute to them, our website came to life.
